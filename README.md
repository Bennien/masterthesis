# masterthesis

The code in this repository accompanies the thesis with the title: Model monitoring from a business perspective & ground truth delay by Bibian Bennink. The aim of the code in this notebook is to compare two methods that aim to mitigate the ground truth delay problem. In the notebook, code by others is specifically linked and in the thesis all sources are cited as well.
